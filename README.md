# SpeechT5 Fine-Tuning for My Voice

## Description
This project fine-tunes the [SpeechT5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/speecht5_tts) model for text-to-speech synthesis using my own voice in the Czech language. The Hugging Face ecosystem was used for model implementation and training. The main inspiration and reference for this work was [this tutorial](https://github.com/emirhanbilgic/Turkish-TTS).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 172 short audio recordings (2â€“20 seconds each), where I read one or two sentences in Czech. The total duration is about 20 minutes. The dataset is private to prevent misuse or unauthorized cloning of my voice.

## Model and Results
The best trained model is also kept private for the same reason. I have shared at least sample output: one generated audio file from the model and a reference file of me reading the same text.
